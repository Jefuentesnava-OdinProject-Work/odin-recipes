    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This spicy red Thai curry recipe transforms coconut milk, Thai basil, and skinless, boneless chicken thighs into a flavorful meal in under an hour.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons red curry paste, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 (13.5 ounce) can full-fat coconut milk</li>
        <li>4 (5 ounces) boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>6 leaf (blanks)s lime leaves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fish sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 (.6 ounces) package Thai basil</li>
        <li>2 cups cooked jasmine rice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add ginger and garlic and saute for 2 minutes. Stir in red curry paste, let sizzle for a few seconds, then pour in coconut milk. Bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce to a simmer, stir a little, and wait for the oil to rise to the surface. Add chicken thighs and lime leaves and simmer until the chicken is cooked through and no longer pink in the centers, about 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add fish sauce and brown sugar and taste--if you like it a little saltier, add more fish sauce; if you like it sweeter, add a little more sugar.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, then take off the heat and add Thai basil.</li>
        <li>Spoon the curry into a bowl. Serve with jasmine rice.</li>
    </ol>
